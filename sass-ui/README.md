## Notes on Next.js 16 Upgrade

This project has been upgraded from Next.js 14 → 16 using `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`, with the following key changes applied:

- **Middleware → Proxy:** `src/middleware.ts` has been renamed to `src/proxy.ts` and now exports `proxy` instead of `middleware`.
- **Async request APIs:** `cookies()` and other request APIs are now async; the logout route at `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` has been updated to `await cookies()`.
- **Async params in client routes:** Dynamic client routes under `app/(protected)/*/[id]/page.tsx` now treat `params` as `Promise<{ id: string }>` and unwrap them with `React.use(params)`.
- **Type safety:** All TypeScript errors related to the upgrade have been resolved (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes).
